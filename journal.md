## June 25th: Research, Schematic, and PCB Layout
Hi! I'm back with a new project, while my keyboard is being reviewed and other projects are stuck in shipping, I decided to make another project! I've seen lots of ppl getting their accounts hacked, especially my parents, so I decided to make a Security Key USB! This way, accounts can stay secure, I'll learn dev-board design - sorta - (2nd Dev Board I have ever designed, 1st was a ESP32-S3 embedded in a High Speed Competition Level Line Following Robot). So today I researched a lot, made my schematic, and made the layout of my PCB. Now I need to assign netclasses, do the routing, and route the firmware. Oh and I also need to make the case and modular keypad.

I made the schematic based off of Raspberry Pi's design files to minimize errors. Rlly excited for this bc my old Microsoft Account got hacked and I lost minecraft :(

**Total time spent: 3.5hrs**

## June 25th - Log 2: Done with the routing
Damn that was fast, I'm done with all the routing rn. I didnt add the connector yet for the keypad becuase I think that will need another MCU on the keypad, I'll see what to do for the keypad and then do that too, I think this is gonna be done by today becuase I'm already done with 99% of the PCB and Schematic lol.
