## June 25th: Research, Schematic, and PCB Layout
Hi! I'm back with a new project, while my keyboard is being reviewed and other projects are stuck in shipping, I decided to make another project! I've seen lots of ppl getting their accounts hacked, especially my parents, so I decided to make a Security Key USB! This way, accounts can stay secure, I'll learn dev-board design - sorta - (2nd Dev Board I have ever designed, 1st was a ESP32-S3 embedded in a High Speed Competition Level Line Following Robot). So today I researched a lot, made my schematic, and made the layout of my PCB. Now I need to assign netclasses, do the routing, and route the firmware. Oh and I also need to make the case and modular keypad.

I made the schematic based off of Raspberry Pi's design files to minimize errors. Rlly excited for this bc my old Microsoft Account got hacked and I lost minecraft :(

**Total time spent: 3.5hrs**

## June 25th - Log 2: Done with the routing
Damn that was fast, I'm done with all the routing rn. I didnt add the connector yet for the keypad becuase I think that will need another MCU on the keypad, I'll see what to do for the keypad and then do that too, I think this is gonna be done by today becuase I'm already done with 99% of the PCB and Schematic lol.

Edit/Update: I ain't adding the keypad for now because I want this to be user friendly so for now no numpad, sorry!

**Total time spent: 55mins**

# June 26th: Making the component models

Damn that took a long time and I didn't even make the case yet, I had to asign all the 3D Models to the PCB so I can make a proper case, for some components I had to make the 3D Models myself! Which took a veryyy long time, now I'll finally start the enclosure in Fusion 260.

## June 29th: This dosen't feel like a hobby it feels like child labor

I am almost done with my case, I have litarally been working for 3 days straight no sleep, worked over 30 iterations and finaly came to one I like and actually fits the PCBs Screw Holes, I had to modify my PCB to have larger holes because I'm not screwing it in, instead it will go through the parts where I'll screw, and sit on standoffs, everything is one model so no external hardware needed except for Self Tapping screws, why slef tapping? Because I'm screwing them directly into the print, I was also thinking of like maybe a acrylic see through top for the RGB LED, it would look very good. Now I just need to do the finishing touches (I dont get paid enough for this, I'll just be getting $50 which is too low of a budget aghhhhh)

**Total time spent: 3 days straight minus food breaks and other stuff = 67hrs**

## June 29th - Log 2: Done!

The sun is rising as I'm done with the case! Like actually it's sunrise, so I uhh have added all the finishing touches and everything. Everything fits properly and it looks good. But the buttons dont have any caps on them so u need to put ur finger through to press them, now I'll just upload all relevant files and submit in a bit.
